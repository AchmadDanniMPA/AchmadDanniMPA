# Hey, I'm Danni 👋

I'm a final-year student in Business Information Systems (SIB) with a curiosity-first mindset.  
I like understanding how things work—whether it's **web development**, **game systems**, or **weird algorithms**—and making them work better.  

Lately, I've been integrating **AI tools** into almost everything I do, from coding to brainstorming ideas to optimizing workflows.

## 🧠 What I'm into:
- 🔧 Learning how systems are built (and broken)
- 🤖 Making AI do the boring stuff
- 🕹 Game dev (when I’m not being chased by deadlines)
- 🧪 Trying, failing, tweaking, and repeating

---

## 🚧 What I’m working on:
- Building a cleaner portfolio (it's under construction, I promise)
- Exploring backend, testing, and system analysis for internship prep
- Slowly making peace with Git
